Z280 Computer
=============

###### *Started October 29, 2022*

This is intended to be a series of computers using the Z280, similar to the
[Computie project](https://jabberwocky.ca/projects/computie/).  The first board will be
a prototyping board with the CPU's basic needs (clock/pullup resistors/etc) and some RAM
and Flash memory, plus an expansion bus that an Arduino can be connected to.  The bus pin
assignments match Computie's Supervisor shield, so that the flash chip can be programmed
using the same harness.  I have no idea if this will work, and I haven't even tried to
get a software environment set up yet.
